## WELCOME
We are glad that you're interested in research! Our aim is to provide useful insights, lessons, and recommendations for conducting _computer science_ research, and much of this content might be applicable to other fields, too. 

We recognize that unfortunately research can be a dizzying and confusing process, as the nature of it is quite distinct from anything else taught in formal education. For example, the objective of courses is to teach a foundation of knowledge that is widely-accepted as being accurate and truthful. Quite often, this involves learning a set of skills necessary to interpret and leverage that knowledge. However, research inherently concerns building on to that foundation of knowledge and attempting to extend it. That is, one asks specific questions and then dives into unknown territory so as to discover new world knowledge that nobody yet knows. The type of research contribution (i.e., new knowledge) can vary widely, from making advances in _modelling_, illustrating new insights about _data_, devising a new scientific _task_, and much more. To help provide guidance on the research process, we share our personal experiences and advice.

## ENROLLMENT
The demand for this course content is extremely high, and unfortunately, to ensure the quality of education, we must cap the total enrollment this semester. All interested students must [request permission](googleform) to take the course. Selections will be made simply on a first-come, first-serve basis, amongst those who attend the first lecture and have the necessary pre-reqs.

### PREREQUISITES
No prior NLP experience is expected or necessary, but students must have a basic foundation in probability and calculus, along with strong knowledge of Machine Learning. See the [syllabus](syllabus) for more details, along with [HW #0 (ungraded)](hw0) to assess if your current knowledge is aligned with the pre-req expectations -- you should be able to answer all of the questions without much difficulty.

### CS187 vs CS287
Students interested in learning NLP should take either this course or Stuart Shieber's CS187 (Introduction to Computational Linguistics and NLP), which is also offered this semester! I describe [the differences here](187vs287).
