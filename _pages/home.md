## WELCOME
We are glad that you're interested in research! <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Our aim is to provide a brief crash course on computer science research, which includes our insights, lessons, and recommendations.</span> Ideally, this content is applicable to other scientific fields, too. We hope this will be useful to new grad students or early-career researchers as they begin their journey. 

We recognize that unfortunately research can be a dizzying and confusing process, as the nature of it is quite distinct from anything else taught in formal education. For example, generally the objective of courses is to teach a foundation of knowledge that is widely-accepted as being accurate and truthful. Quite often, this involves learning a set of skills necessary to interpret and leverage that knowledge, too. However, research inherently concerns building on to the field's foundation of knowledge and attempting to extend it. That is, one asks specific questions and then dives into unknown territory so as to discover new world knowledge that nobody yet knows. The type of research contribution (i.e., new knowledge) can vary widely, from making advances in _modelling_, illustrating new insights about _data_, devising a new scientific _task_, and much more. To help provide guidance on the research process, we share our personal experiences and advice via the following organization:
- [What](what) is research?
- [How](how) to do it?
- [Exercises](exercises) to gain practice
- Supplemental [resources](resources) that we recommend

Chris and David met as Computer Science PhD students at [Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu/).
- Chris began machine learning research during a summer internship in 2004. After completing a Master's at [UCLA](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/), he joined [MIT Lincoln Lab](https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/artificial-intelligence-technology-and-systems) from 2009-2012 as an Associate Staff Researcher within the Human Language Technology (i.e., NLP) group. He completed a PhD in Natural Language Processing under Eugene Charniak at [Brown](http://cs.brown.edu/people/echarnia/) from 2012-2019. Afterwards, he joined [Harvard's](https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/) Institute for Applied Computational Science as a lecturer, where he researches NLP and teaches graduate courses on ML, NLP, and Data Science. 
- David began research at Carleton College, where he _____.
