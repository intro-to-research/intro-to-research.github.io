title: How to do Research?

As mentioned in the [What?](what?) page, research always concerns a highly specific problem/task/issue, and it aims to produce new knowledge about it. Thus, we organize our suggestions for "how to conduct research" accordingly: first, we detail some tips about finding an interesting problem to work on, then we briefly outline some steps to dive into the problem. The [exercises](exercises) page expands on this much more.

## HOW TO FIND A RESEARCH PROBLEM (broad to specific)

- Big picture: look at prof’s research interests
- Identify top-tier conferences (even if it’s not where you’ll submit, good to know what’s being done)
- Scan many Abstracts, Introductions, Conclusions
- Take notes about common problems, datasets, approaches, metrics.

## RESEARCH PROBLEM AXES
- Size of contribution/impact
- Difficulty (Technical? Or more broad notion?)
	- Uncertainty
	- Difficulty of knowing how to tackle the problem
- Opening vs. Closing vs. Increment?
- In wheelhouse/out of wheelhouse
- Competitive Advantage
- Follow ups, cascades, open up new areas (can you envision pivots?)

## RESEARCH EXERCISES AND ACTIVITIES
- Read a paper and identify two strengths and two weaknesses.
- Read a paper and present it to a wider audience from the mindset of the authors.
- Write a related work section for a specific area.
- Isolate a theorem/model/equation and understand it:
	- Why is it true?
	- What are the key assumptions/steps that it rests on?
	- Why are any assumptions needed/important?
	- How can you summarize the theorem in one sentence?
- Before diving into literature in a space, give yourself a safe scratchpad of ideas:
	- What are you curious about?
	- What sparks your interest / do you think is important to work on?
	- Might be worth revisiting after you’ve seen a bit of the literature


## NICE TO HAVE / WHERE TO PUT THESE?
- what/how: Importance of collaborations (short examples of how to find collaborators?)
- how: Investing in your tools
- how: Complexity should be earned
- how: Failing fast vs perfectionism
- what/how: Oracle / George Box quote "All models are wrong, but some are useful"
- how: Prioritizing (e.g., yak shaving and bikeshedding)

## BEYOND OUR SCOPE
- Overcoming roadblocks?
- How to get into PhD programs?
- Finding a long-term research vision/narrative?
