We strongly recommend you first read our [What?](what?) page, if you haven't already. As it mentions, research always concerns a highly specific problem/task/issue, and it aims to produce new knowledge about it. Thus, we organize our suggestions for "how to conduct research" accordingly: first, we detail some tips about finding an interesting problem to work on, then we briefly outline some steps to dive into the problem. The [exercises](exercises) page expands on this much more. Remember, conducting research is an art, and it can take many years to become effective. Heck, learning how to do it is the entire purpose of a PhD, which typically lasts 5-7 years. So, please do not interpret our suggestions below as being prescriptive, comprehensive, infallible truth. It is simply our advice.

## HOW TO FIND A RESEARCH PROBLEM

### 1. FIND AN AREA
Before you can find a specific problem that you enjoy, you must first pinpoint an area/field that you're interested in. For example, within computer science, common fields include:
- Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Systems and Architecture
- Computer Vision (CV), Graphics, and Visualization
- Programming Languages (PL)
- Distrubuted Systems
- Networks
- Databases
- Robotics
- Security
- Algorithms
- Theory
- Computational Biology
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
- Education

<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The best way to gain knowledge and exposure to an area is to take courses in it,</span> as courses provide an introduction and foundation to the widely-accepted and highly useful knowledge in the field. Again, all of the information in courses was at some point late-breaking research findings. Moreover, the material in an introductory course is often the product of thousands of researchers contributing incremental results to a field across many decades.

Only after having learned a foundation (e.g., taken at least 1 class in the area), is it conducive to conduct research and aim to discover something that the community doesn't yet know. Alternatively, it is common for graduate courses to be "seminar" style, whereby students simultaneously extend their foundation of knowledge and work on a related research project for the course. Here, this is permissible because the expectation is that the students already have a strong foundation -- often in the exact material, or at a minimum, a related field -- and are interested in research. For example, in Chris' [Deep Learning for NLP](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/CS287/) graduate course, he doesn't expect students to have prior NLP knowledge, but students must have significant experience with Machine Learning, which is critical for their research projects in the course.

**TIP:** Don't quickly dismiss an entire area just because you do not enjoy a particular course in it. Think critically to assess if it's the actual content that you find unenjoyable, or if it's just the professor's teaching style that does not align with you.

### 2. FIND A PROBLEM
Finding a problem to work on is often times the hardest part of conducting research, as it predicates upon having enough knowledge of current work to know what would be a novel contribution. Keep in mind, there are many levels of granularity to finding a problem. For example, within the area of NLP, one can enumerate a dozen of the most common "problems" that people research, such as:
- machine translation: converting text from one language to another
- summarization: generating succinct summaries of documents that includes the most important information
- language modelling: developing ways to accurately estimate the probability of a sequence of words
- question-answering: given some documents, and a query (e.g., "In which country is Rome located?"), return an answer

All of these are coarse problems and can be thought of as sub-fields. They are not yet specific enough to constitute a research project, as they encompass a host of problems that people have worked on for decades. One can spend an entire career conducting research on any of these problems. For example, if one is interested in machine translation, one could research:
- overall performance (accuracy)
- performance of "low-resource" languages (not much data)
- zero-shot translation (translate between pairs of languages that the model wasn't trained on)
- computational efficiency
- many more

For context, most researchers work on many different specific projects (e.g., "low-resource machine translation") for a particular problem (e.g., machine translation). And, people commonly research several different problems within a field (e.g., summarization and question-answering, which are both within the field of NLP). Less common, but definitely not rare, a given researcher will span multiple fields within one's career (e.g., NLP and Computer Vision). Some fields are naturally more interdisciplinary than others (e.g., Human-Computer Interaction, Computational Biology).

We recommend two main options for _selecting_ a specific problem and consequently a project:

- (A) **Ask a potential adviser** (e.g., professor, lecturer, senior grad student) in your department if they need help with any project. 
- (B) **Read/skim tons of research papers** on your own.

NOTE: these two options are not mutually-exclusive, and they are closely related and intertwined with the process of finding an adviser to work with. So, we will address both. Inevitably, your project will not be entirely independent, and this is especially true and critical for your first few years of research. If you are an undergraduate or new graduate student, you will conduct research with a particular adviser (e.g., professor, lecturer, post-doc, senior PhD student); you'll do nearly 100% of the work, but you will report your results to your adviser and they will provide feedback according to the results you report to them. Thus, it will be a joint effort between you and your adviser. So, regardless of if you do #2 (read tons of papers) or not, you'll need to do #1 (ask for someone to advise you).

**(A) ASKING A PROFESSOR/OTHERS FOR RESEARCH PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES:**

In short, there's an inverse correlation between the degree to which you already know a particular, potential adviser and how familiar you might need to be with the field, problem, project before discussing research opportunities with them. The smoothest and most streamlined scenario is when a student contacts a potential adviser and already has an exact project in mind. This doesn't have to be a new, novel project; it can be an existing project that the adviser works on with other students (this is very common). Having a project in mind is much easier for the adviser and is a golden scenario because, again, it takes a significant cognitive effort to craft well-scoped, appropriate ideas for a research project, and this is further complicated when one has to adjust the work to best align with others' current knowledge and abilities. 

As a quick example for perspective, I am flattered and happy that a few dozen strangers per year cold-email me, asking me if I have any research opportunities for them to work with me on. They include their CV/resume and are strong students from international universities. They tend to have some machine learning experience in the form of a few courses and projects/internships. However, if they don't have much or any NLP experience, I cannot consider working with them. I have no reason to doubt that they aren't capable of producing great research, but I'd have to help teach them a foundation in NLP and there are a lot of uncertainties: I am unfamiliar with their school, professors, and employer; they haven't yet demonstrated any profiency in NLP; and, critically, they haven't demonstrated passion for a particular NLP problem. I wish I could collaborate with every interested student, but unfortunately I have a finite amount of time. The discussed scenario, overall, is a huge risk for me to take. Their lack of NLP experience and targeted passion signals that I would most likely need to hand-feed the entire project to them. If a student simply, blindly executes every instruction I suggest, it would not be conducive to a healthy and productive environment. Also, there would be no guarantee that they would find the work exciting or fulfilling, which is critically important, as I want every student to love what they work on.

**AN ESTABLISHED CONNECTION:**
Ideally, you should already have some rapport with the potential adviser. For example, perhaps you have taken 1 or 2 classes with a professor, or you've shared a seminar class w/ a senior PhD student and you two worked on the same course project together. And, depending on your relation, you may already feel comfortable having a casual conversation with them, whereby you could ask about their research, with the hopes of seeing if there's a shared interest in the work. 

**A LIMITED RELATION:**
If you have a limited relation to the potential adviser (e.g., having taken just 1 large-enrollment course with the adviser, and they don't know you by name), it is greatly helpful -- although not required -- if you could first learn about the types of problems they work on before you speak with them. This is mostly possible by reading their website (hopefully they have one) and reading the titles of their papers (or the entire paper if possible). Depending on the relation, I'd recommend spending _at most_ two days on this prep-work. The goal is just to become a little more familiar with the terms and types of problems, so that it's a more fruitful and meaningful conversation with the adviser. This groundwork will help you self-determine your own interests, but don't dwell on this steps too much or place unhealthy pre-requisites for yourself. Heck, the adviser might not even have any available research opportunities.

**NO RELATION:**
If you have no relation to the potential adviser (e.g., they work at a different university and you have no shared connections), then it's much more necessary to have read their works and to be prepared for the type of research that you are hoping for them to engage with you on.

[Yonathan Bisk has a great page](https://yonatanbisk.com/emailing_professors.html) that details some aspects about emailing professors.

Once you have spoken with an adviser about potential projects, the expectation is that you two might work together. During these initial stages, it is extremely helpful to read/skim tons of papers concerning the problem or specific project. This will not only help you catch up and learn about the area, but it'll help you determine if it's something you truly find interesting.

**DON'T BE SHY OR INTIMIDATED**
It is highly rewarding and fun to help a student navigate the process of research, and to introduce them to their first research experiences -- even if that means connecting the student with other professors who work on topics that are better aligned with the student's. The bottom line is that if you are interested in research, please do not be shy at all when reaching out to others for opportunities! Do not feel obligated to have well-understood an entire field or problem ahead of time; if everyone waited to master a field or problem before they embark on researching it, then no research and advances would ever occur. Students are a huge driving force behind a majority of research in the world, and we welcome everyone who is interested -- regardless of one's background.


**(B) READ/SKIM PAPERS**

Reading research papers can be a non-obvious and difficult task, one that can take a while to become effective. Please see our section on this further down in this web page. In short, please do not feel intimidated by or obligated to read an adviser's papers ahead of time; in fact, just reading their paper titles and doing a few web searches can be a tremendous help.

If you're just starting out in a new field (e.g., NLP), you must first learn what are the premiere research venues for publication. In Computer Science, conferences are the gold standard for disseminating research findings, not journals.

**IDENTIFY THE TOP-TIER CONFERENCES:**

You can do this by looking at where prolific researchers in the field tend to publish. A professor's list of publications is usually located on their website, along with Google Scholar or Semantic Scholar. For AI-related fields, you can visit [https://aideadlin.es/?sub=ML,NLP,SP](https://aideadlin.es/?sub=ML,NLP,SP). For context, each field tends to have just 3-4 "top-tier" conferences, nearly all of which are yearly and with free access to all publications. You can find a given conference's accepted papers by searching online for "[CONFERENCE NAME] [YEAR] accepted papers" (e.g., "NAACL 2021 accepted papers").

**READ AND TAKE NOTES:**
Once you have identified the top venues, gain an understanding of the most common problems by reading/skimming tons of paper titles from the last 2-3 years. It's also highly useful to look at the tutorials, workshops, and shared tasks from each of the conferences. Also, you can get an indication of the important problems by looking at graduate course syllabi to see what is covered in the curriculum. 

As you read papers and become familiar with the field, take extensive notes on the common problems, datasets, approaches, metrics, and authors who work you enjoy. Your perspective of the field and problems will likely significantly shift during the first few weeks, so don't underestimate the power of taking and reviewing notes. I suggest using a medium/format that will encourage you to be free and comfortable in your writing, one that doesn't stifle your creativity and thoughts. For example, for me, a simple, no-frills text editor (e.g., emacs, Sublime, or Evernote) is most conducive for notetaking and brainstorming, and when I want to come up with research ideas, I prefer to use a piece of scratch paper and pen.

## RESEARCH PROBLEM AXES
- Size of contribution/impact
- Difficulty (Technical? Or more broad notion?)
	- Uncertainty
	- Difficulty of knowing how to tackle the problem
- Opening vs. Closing vs. Increment?
- In wheelhouse/out of wheelhouse
- Competitive Advantage
- Follow ups, cascades, open up new areas (can you envision pivots?)

## RESEARCH EXERCISES AND ACTIVITIES
- Read a paper and identify two strengths and two weaknesses.
- Read a paper and present it to a wider audience from the mindset of the authors.
- Write a related work section for a specific area.
- Isolate a theorem/model/equation and understand it:
	- Why is it true?
	- What are the key assumptions/steps that it rests on?
	- Why are any assumptions needed/important?
	- How can you summarize the theorem in one sentence?
- Before diving into literature in a space, give yourself a safe scratchpad of ideas:
	- What are you curious about?
	- What sparks your interest / do you think is important to work on?
	- Might be worth revisiting after you’ve seen a bit of the literature
