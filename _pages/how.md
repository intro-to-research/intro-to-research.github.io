title: How to do Research?

As mentioned in the [What?](what?) page, research always concerns a highly specific problem/task/issue, and it aims to produce new knowledge about it. Thus, we organize our suggestions for "how to conduct research" accordingly: first, we detail some tips about finding an interesting problem to work on, then we briefly outline some steps to dive into the problem. The [exercises](exercises) page expands on this much more. Remember, conducting research is an art, and it can take many years to become effective. Heck, learning how to do it is the entire purpose of a PhD, which typically lasts 5-7 years. So, please do not interpret our suggestions below as being prescriptive, infallible truth.

## HOW TO FIND A RESEARCH PROBLEM

### 1. FIND AN AREA
Before you can find a specific problem that you enjoy, you must first pinpoint an area/field that you're interested in. For example, within computer science, common fields include:
- Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Systems and Architecture
- Computer Vision (CV), Graphics, and Visualization
- Programming Languages (PL)
- Distrubuted Systems
- Networks
- Databases
- Robotics
- Security
- Algorithms
- Theory
- Computational Biology
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
- Education

<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The best way to gain knowledge and exposure to an area is to take courses in it,</span> as courses provide an introduction and foundation to the widely-accepted and highly useful knowledge in the field. Again, all of the information in courses was at some point late-breaking research findings. Moreover, the material in an introductory course is often the product of thousands of researchers contributing incremental results to a field across many decades.

Only after having learned a foundation (e.g., taken at least 1 class in the area), is it conducive to conduct research and aim to discover something that the community doesn't yet know. Alternatively, it is common for graduate courses to be "seminar" style, whereby students simultaneously extend their foundation of knowledge and work on a related research project for the course. Here, this is permissible because the expectation is that the students already have a strong foundation -- often in the exact material, or at a minimum, a related field -- and are interested in research. For example, in Chris' "Deep Learning for NLP' graduate course, he doesn't expect students to have prior NLP knowledge, but students must have significant epxerience with Machine Learning, which is critical for their research projects in the course.

**TIP:** Don't quickly dismiss an entire area just because you do not enjoy a particular course in it. Think critically to assess if it's the actual content that you find unenjoyable, or if it's just the professor's teaching style that does not align with you.

### 2. FIND A PROBLEM
Finding a problem to work on is often times the hardest part of conducting research, as it predicates upon having enough knowledge of current work to know what would be a novel contribution. Keep in mind, there are many levels of granularity to finding a problem. For example, within the area of NLP, one can enumerate a dozen of the most common "problems" that people work on (i.e., research), such as:
- machine translation: converting text from one language to another
- summarization: generating succinct summaries of documents that includes the most important information
- language modelling: developing ways to accurately estimate the probability of a sequence of words
- natural language understanding (NLU): classifying the _intent_ and select fields are for a given user query (e.g., "Play Drivers License by Olivia" and knowing that "play" is the intent, "drivers license" is the song, and "Olivia" is the artist).

All of these are coarse problems and can be thought of as sub-fields. They are not yet specific enough to constitute a research project, as they encompass a host of problems that people have worked on for decades. One can spend an entire career conducting research on any of these problems. For example, if one is interested in machine translation, one could research:
- overall performance (accuracy)
- performance of "low-resource" languages (not much data)
- zero-shot translation (translate between pairs of languages that the model wasn't trained on)
- computational efficiency
- many more

For context, most researchers work on many different specific projects (e.g., "low-resource machine translation") for a particular problem (e.g., machine translation). And, people commonly research several different problems within a field (e.g., machine translation and summarization, which are both within the field of NLP). Less common, but definitely not rare, a given researcher will span multiple fields within one's career (e.g., NLP and Computer Vision). Some fields are naturally more interdisciplinary than others (e.g., Human-Computer Interaction, Computational Biology).

- Big picture: look at prof’s research interests
- Identify top-tier conferences (even if it’s not where you’ll submit, good to know what’s being done)
- Scan many Abstracts, Introductions, Conclusions
- Take notes about common problems, datasets, approaches, metrics.

## RESEARCH PROBLEM AXES
- Size of contribution/impact
- Difficulty (Technical? Or more broad notion?)
	- Uncertainty
	- Difficulty of knowing how to tackle the problem
- Opening vs. Closing vs. Increment?
- In wheelhouse/out of wheelhouse
- Competitive Advantage
- Follow ups, cascades, open up new areas (can you envision pivots?)

## RESEARCH EXERCISES AND ACTIVITIES
- Read a paper and identify two strengths and two weaknesses.
- Read a paper and present it to a wider audience from the mindset of the authors.
- Write a related work section for a specific area.
- Isolate a theorem/model/equation and understand it:
	- Why is it true?
	- What are the key assumptions/steps that it rests on?
	- Why are any assumptions needed/important?
	- How can you summarize the theorem in one sentence?
- Before diving into literature in a space, give yourself a safe scratchpad of ideas:
	- What are you curious about?
	- What sparks your interest / do you think is important to work on?
	- Might be worth revisiting after you’ve seen a bit of the literature


## NICE TO HAVE / WHERE TO PUT THESE?
- what/how: Importance of collaborations (short examples of how to find collaborators?)
- how: Investing in your tools
- how: Complexity should be earned
- how: Failing fast vs perfectionism
- what/how: Oracle / George Box quote "All models are wrong, but some are useful"
- how: Prioritizing (e.g., yak shaving and bikeshedding)

## BEYOND OUR SCOPE
- Overcoming roadblocks?
- How to get into PhD programs?
- Finding a long-term research vision/narrative?
