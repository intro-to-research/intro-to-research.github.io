title: What is Research?

<hr>

Imagine building a birdhouse. Typically, you're given supplies and an instruction booklet, and perhaps even a kind woodworking teacher to walk you through aspects of the process. With an instruction booklet and instructor, this scenario is much like school---follow the steps, use some of your own ingenuity, put it some hard work, and at the end of the process you have a bird house. Research, on the other hand, is the process of observing the world, seeing a bird, and deciding to construct a shelter for it. You decide the nature of the structure and its purpose. You have no instruction booklet. And, ultimately, you don't know if the thing you build at the end of the day will serve the purpose you intended.

A birdhouse here is an abstraction of the kinds of scientific artifacts one might produce. 

## NATURE OF ROLES
Possibly an intro describing how not all companies need or have the luxury of a research team.

### Software/Product Development vs Research vs Manager
A paragraph illustrating different job roles (e.g., lego or birdhouse example)

## CONCRETE RESEARCH PROBLEM TYPES
Research is largely question-asking, then question-answering. Some of these questions, we (the world/community) already know the answer to, some we don’t. Research is often a matter of identifying the important, useful questions and delivering compelling answers to them. Not all research fits the question-answer mold, but much of it does. Following this template, there are a number of concrete types of research projects:
- Pure theory: the artifact is typically a theorem or other form of analysis. Given a particular kind of formalism, this work sheds new light on some property of the formal system. For example, Shannon's celebrated "[A Mathematical Theory of Communication](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~hungngo/classes/2003/Markov_Chains/papers/p3-shannon.pdf)" establishes seminal results that formalise the process of communication in the presence of noise. This work develops new concepts, definitions, proves new upper and lower bounds, and comes along with relevant algorithms.
- Implement another paper
- Bring new understanding to another approach/algorithm: Algorithm X has been applied mostly to problem/data/setting Y, but can it handle this other case? (Yes/No, both directions interesting).
- Find a weakness in an existing approach
- Connecting two ideas: for instance, if problem X has been around, and someone proposes a data model/dataset/setting, revisiting problem X with the new model/dataset/setting.
- Develop a new dataset (hard): Often times research progress can be driven across the broader community by a common benchmark. It is difficult to measure progress if we all use different tests -- for this reason, it can be immensely valuable to identify the right benchmarks to unite a community. 
- Showcase properties of an existing dataset
- “Shlogging”: Results that take existing bounds and remove extraneous factors.
- Opinion/perspective piece
- Surveys
- Introduce a new problem

## END RESULT / GOALS
Mention the flow of knowledge; research that is widely accepted and valued makes its way into textbooks and undergraduate curriculums.

## WHAT RESEARCH IS NOT
- Application building that's exclusively problem solving or software development
- work that only uses existing methods with no new insights

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES
By the end of the course, you will be able to:
- understand the theoretical concepts behind the common NLP tasks and models
- write effective programming solutions to popular problems in NLP
- tackle your own, novel goals with text data once this course is over (e.g., if you have downloaded thousands of tweets over the past week, you’ll be able to come up with reasonable solutions to (1) identify sentiments about any phrase; (2) make classification predictions; (3) identify aliases for any entity, and much more)
- conduct substantial, original NLP research (e.g., critically read papers published in top conferences, understand them, and execute your own ideas so as to answer novel research questions)
